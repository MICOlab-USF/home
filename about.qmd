**Margaret (Maggi) Mars Brisbin** (she/her) is the PI of the MICO lab and an Assistant Professor at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science. Maggi completed her Ph.D. at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (Japan), where she worked under Prof. Satoshi Mitarai to comprehensively characterize the symbiosis between acantharian protists and the Haptophyte phytoplankton *Phaeocystis*. Side projects and ongoing interests from Okinawa include investigating how typhoons and urbanization disturb coastal ecosystems. Recent research focuses on positive and negative interactions between *Phaeocystis* and their colony microbiomes, and the impact these interactions may have on bloom formation. Maggi is passionate about science communication, outreach, and building an inclusive and supportive lab.<br /> [![twitter](images/twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/MargaretBrisbin) [![email](images/email.png)](mailto:mmarsbrisbin@usf.com) [![scholar](images/scholar.png)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cx44qVMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
