    "text": "The MICO Lab at USF is led by Dr. Margaret (Maggi) Mars Brisbin. The core focus of the lab is to unravel and interpret interactions between marine microbes in the context of changing ocean ecosystems. Overarching research aims are to determine how microbial interactions contribute to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem function, how these interactions will respond to climate change, and how changes in the dynamics of these relationships will feedback on climate change impacts. The MICO lab uses multiple meta’omics and advanced microscopy techniques in conjunction with culture experiments and environmental sampling to tackle the following questions:\n\nWhat are the mechanisms of interaction between microbes in aquatic systems? How do phytoplankton or other hosts identify and select or recruit specific symbiotic partners? How are the relationships mediated? How does the relationship benefit the organisms involved, e.g., does the relationship provide a limiting nutrient or increase photosynthetic output?\nHow do microbial interactions evolve? How quickly are new interactions established? How resilient are interactions to environmental change? Will climate impacts “break” or otherwise impact ecologically important microbial interactions?\nWhat are the ecological impacts if specific microbial interactions are disturbed? Will carbon fixation or sequestration decrease if interactions are diminished? How would such changes propagate through the food web?\n\nThe MICO lab is microbe agnostic and is generally intrigued by all interesting and ecologically relevant microbial interactions. Some systems of particular interest are acantharian-Phaeocystis symbioses, Phaeocystis colony-microbiome interactions, and bacterial interactions with the HAB-forming dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: An acanatharian with Phaeocystis antarctica endosymbionts collected from the Southern Ocean on the Palmer LTER cruise and imaged with Prakash Lab custom microscopes; Center: A Phaeocystis antarctica colony speckled with bacteria that was imaged with the Imaging Flow Cytobot aboard the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer in the Southern Ocean; Right: Pyrodinium bahamense cells collected in Old Tampa Bay and imaged with light microscopy by FWRI."

    "section": "Everyone",
    "text": "Everyone\nThese expectations and responsibilities are for everyone: PI, postdocs, technicians, grad students, undergrads, and visiting researchers. They are broken down into some big picture items and some more granular, smaller picture guidelines.\n\nBig Picture\nThe truth is that science is hard, but it can also be really fun. In the MICO Lab, we want to maximize the fun, while still doing good science. We want to make sure that everyone experiences a positive, engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding lab environment. To maintain that environment, we all have to do a few things:\n\nWork on what you’re passionate about, work hard at it, be proud of it, have fun at it.\nBe extremely careful. Think things through, double and triple check, implement sanity checks, and ask others to check plans and results. Don’t rush. It’s OK not to be fast!\nMistakes happen, don’t keep them a secret. By sharing mistakes and talking through them, we learn from them and prevent others from making the same mistakes. Discussing and rectifying mistakes early, prevents bigger problems later on. No one should feel ashamed for making a mistake.\nUphold academic integrity (i.e., no plagiarizing, manipulating data, inventing data, or omitting data). Science is about finding out the truth, and null or unexpected results are still important. Some of the most interesting science has stemmed from unexpected results!\nSupport your lab-mates. Help them out if they need help. A lot of work in our lab is labor and time intensive (e.g., daily measurements for growth-curves, filtering liters and liters of sea water, washing and washing and washing glassware) and often a little help can go a long way. Help others, and you can expect others to help you when you need it.\nRespect your lab-mates. Respect their strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it, and for support and a kind ear when they need that. Respect their culture, their religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation.\nIf you’re struggling, tell someone (feel free to tell Maggi). Your health and happiness should always come first and the lab should look out for the well-being of all its members. We are here to help. It’s OK to go through hard patches (we all do). Don’t be shy about asking for help or just venting, but it’s also not necessary to share any details of your situation if you do not want to. Simply sharing that you are facing a challenging time is enough for others to lend extra compassion and support.\nIf there is any tension or hostility in the lab, it should be addressed as soon as possible. No one can thrive when they feel threatened or disrespected. Tell Maggi about conflicts so we can move towards resolving them quickly.\nIf you have a problem with Maggi and are comfortable telling her, do it! If you aren’t comfortable telling her, talk to another faculty member in CMS you are comfortable talking to or to an administrator.\nMaintain work life balance, take care of your mental and physical health, take care of your friends and family, do what brings you joy, and never feel bad for taking time off of work.\n\n\n\nSmall Picture\nThese are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind that will keep the lab running smoothly:\n\nKeep the lab clean. As a molecular lab, it is of utmost importance to keep the lab clean. Wipe down surfaces and equipment with 70% EtOH after use, wipe RNA areas with an RNase cleaning agent, clean up spills right away, don’t leave dishes in the sink, keep benches clear, label everything.\nIf you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick.\nNo one is expected to come into lab on weekends or holidays. No one is expected to work late into the night. This lab values productivity and happiness over presenteeism. Get your work done when and where makes you most productive and happiest.\nIf you use something up, replace it or tell Maggi to order more. Take the last PCR strip? Tell Maggi to order more! Use 25 tip boxes? Refill them!\nMake sure the door to the lab is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you’re the last one leaving for the day."

Once a year, I will host a state of the lab meeting where all of this information is formally laid out. However, feel free to ask about any of these things at any time!\n\n\n\nPost-Docs\nIn addition to the guidelines and responsibilities for everyone, postdocs are also expected to:\n\nDevelop an independent line of research.\nKeep a detailed lab notebook (either digital or paper).\nHelp train and mentor students in the lab (both undergraduate and graduate) when they need it—either because they ask, or because I ask you to.\nPresent your work at conferences and seminars.\nApply for grants and/or fellowships .\nApply for jobs (academic or otherwise) when you’re ready. Applying to either academic or non-academic jobs can be grueling, with lots of time required for preparing application materials and prepping for interviews. Ask for help! Let the lab know when you are applying for something. We are rooting for you (and we can learn from your experiences)!\n\n\n\nGraduate Students\nIn addition to the guidelines and responsibilities for everyone, graduate students are also expected to:\n\nDevelop your dissertation research. Your dissertation should have at least 3 substantial experiments or projects that are related to a big-picture question that you have. Much of your work will need to be done independently, but remember that others in lab (especially Maggi!) are there to help you. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!\nKeep a detailed lab notebook (either digital or paper).\nHelp mentor undergraduate students in the lab when they need it—either because they ask, or because I ask you to. Undergrads can also help you collect data.\nPresent your work at conferences and CMS events.\nApply for fellowships and awards.\nThink about what you want for your career—academia (research or teaching), government science (NOAA, USGS, state agencies), industry science (e.g., biomedical, etc.), data science, science writing, something else?)—and talk to Maggi about it to make sure you’re getting the training you need for that career. What you want for your future is what you should be working towards and receiving help for—no single career track is better or more preferred than the others.\nMake sure you meet all college deadlines (e.g., proposal defense, qualifying exams, thesis submission and defense). We can work on a goal timeline together, but ultimately, it is up to you to make it happen.\nPrioritize time for research. Coursework, TAing, and outreach are important, but in the end it’s your research that gets you your Ph.D. or M.Sc.\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Students\nIn addition to the guidelines and responsibilities for everyone, undergraduate students are also expected to:\n\nAssist other lab members with data collection and analysis, as well as lab maintenance tasks, such as cleaning glassware and prepping media.\nKeep a detailed lab notebook (either digital or paper).\nDevelop your weekly schedule by talking to your graduate student mentor or your postdoc mentor. You should be coming to lab every week and scheduling enough time to get your work done.\nIf you are earning course credit for research, you must also attend lab meetings when your schedule permits, present at one lab meeting, and submit a write-up of your research by the end of the semester"

Code should be commented so that less-experienced users can understand what you did and why, and kept along side necessary data in the designated project repository in the lab’s GitHub (https://github.com/MICOlab-USF). If data products are too large to be stored in GitHub, they should be available in an appropriate repository, such as Zenodo or NCBI. Code should also run if an outside user clones the repository, so pay attention to paths.\nTalk to Maggi to have a repository created in the lab GitHub and to be added as a collaborator to the repository so that you can push to it."

    "section": "Authorship",
    "text": "Authorship\nAuthorship can be tricky and can be a major source of tension in labs. Like other labs, we will follow the APA guidelines with respect to authorship:\n“Authorship credit should reflect the individual’s contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published.”\nAt the start of a new project, the student or post-doc taking on the lead role can expect to be first author (talk to Maggi about it if you aren’t sure). Maggi will typically be the last author, unless the project is primarily under the guidance of another PI and Maggi is involved as a secondary PI—then Maggi will be second to last and the main PI will be last. Maggi will typically also be the corresponding author. This is primarily because, as PI, she has a more stable academic email address and can then direct inquiries to the person best equipped to answer. However, if a student or postdoc has a good reason to be corresponding author, they may be corresponding or two corresponding authors can be named. Students, post-docs, technicians, and collaborators who help over the course of the project may be added to the author list depending on their contribution, and their placement will be discussed with all parties involved in the paper. If a student or post-doc takes on a project but subsequently hands it off to another student or post-doc, they will most likely lose first-authorship to that student or post-doc, unless co-first-authorship is appropriate. All of these issues will be discussed openly, and you should feel free to bring them up if you are not sure of your authorship status or want to challenge it."

Try to keep each channel on topic, so that people can subscribe only to the channels that concern them and find information quickly. For messages to one person or a small group, use direct messages.\nFull-time lab members should install Slack on their computers and/or phones. Part-time lab members should also check Slack regularly. You should of course feel free to ignore Slack on evenings and weekends—and Maggi probably will, too!"

That said, hours in academia are more flexible than other jobs (but you should still treat it as a real job (i.e., ~40 hours/week)). The main goal is for you to get your work done, so if you find that you are more productive at home (lab-mates can be chatty sometimes), feel free to work at home. If don’t have any meetings or lab work on a particular day, it might be a good day to work at home. However, please don’t only work at home! Of course, if there are health concerns (e.g., related to COVID-19, etc.), working at home often is perfectly okay.\nI sometimes work during nights and weekends. This means that I will sometimes send emails or Slack messages outside of normal working hours. For the most part, I will try to have these messages scheduled to be sent on Monday or the following morning, but I suspect that this will sometimes fail. I do not expect you to respond until you are back at work (please ignore me!). I do not expect there to be cases when I suddenly and urgently need something from you over the weekend (e.g., for a grant deadline), but should I anticipate that happening, I will bring it up in advance so we can plan accordingly. All this said, I realize that being told you can ignore my messages might not take away the stress of seeing my messages if you check work email or Slack in the evenings or on weekends. If my off-hours messages are unwelcome and cause distress, please talk to me, and I work harder at not bothering you during your time off.\nAlthough I admit that I sometimes work weekends, I try to only do that when absolutely necessary. Please respect that by making sure to give me adequate warning about impending deadlines so that I can get things done for you (e.g., write letters of recommendation, give feedback on manuscripts, etc.) while maintaining my own work-life balance.

Projects at any level of completion (or even not yet started!) can benefit from being presented. These lab meetings can also be used to talk about methods, statistical analyses, new papers, and career development. For paper discussions, everyone must come to lab meeting having read the paper and prepared with comments and questions to contribute. Some weeks we may explore a particular issue and have people read different papers – in that case, come to lab meeting having read your paper and be prepared to summarize it for the group.\nEach trainee (technicians, students, post-docs) is expected to present at least once every semester. These meetings are informal, and you can do what you wish with your slot—just be prepared to contribute something substantive. Lab members are also expected to attend every meeting (obviously, illnesses, doctor appointments, family issues, etc. are a valid reason for missing a meeting). Undergraduate students are encouraged to attend as often as possible (assuming it fits in their course schedule).\nOccasionally, we may have joint lab meetings with other faculty in the department—these may be combined with our weekly lab meeting or be at another time but replace our normal meeting. We will also use lab meetings to prepare for conference presentations and give people feedback on job talks or other external presentations. Lab meeting agendas and notes will be kept in the #lab-meetings channel on Slack.\n\n\nIndividual Meetings\nAt the beginning of each semester, we will set a schedule for weekly meetings. Each full-time lab member (technicians, graduate students, post-docs) will have a one-hour slot set aside to meet with Maggi. If scheduling conflicts arise (e.g., because of travel), we can try to reschedule for another day that week. If there is nothing to discuss, feel free to cancel the meeting or just drop by for a brief chat.\nMaggi will meet with undergraduate students at least every other week (or according to need); post-docs and graduate students should meet with their undergraduate mentee on a regular basis."

Don’t be afraid to bug them about it (yes, bug Maggi as well).\nHere are a few specific guidelines:\n\nGive Maggi at least one week’s notice to do something with a hard deadline that doesn’t require a lot of time (e.g., reading/commenting on conference abstracts, filling out paperwork, etc).\nGive Maggi at least two weeks’ notice (preferably more) to do something with a hard deadline that requires a moderate amount of time (e.g., a letter of recommendation).\nIf you want feedback on research and teaching statements, or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Maggi before a hard deadline, give her as much time as you can; at the very least three weeks.\nFor manuscript submissions and revisions (i.e., which either have no deadline at all or only a weak deadline), send drafts to Maggi as soon as you have them, and bug her to give you feedback if she hasn’t responded in two weeks—papers are important!"

Very few people will read your papers carefully (sad, but true) but you can reach a large audience through conference talks and posters.

Even if you want to leave academia, presentations are likely to be an important part of your job. Additionally, every time you present your work, you are representing not just yourself but the entire lab.\nIt is, therefore, highly encouraged that you seek out opportunities to present your research, whether it is at departmental talk series and events, to other labs (within or outside of USF), at conferences, or to the general public. If you are going to give a presentation (a poster or a talk), be prepared to give a practice presentation to the lab at least one week ahead of time (two weeks or more are advisable for conference presentations, and many weeks ahead of time are advisable for job talks, which require much more refining). Practice talks will help you feel comfortable with your presentation, and will also allow you to get feedback from the lab and implement those changes well in advance of your real presentation."

If the letter is for a grant, also include your specific aims. If the letter is for a faculty position, also include your research and teaching statements. In some cases (especially if short notice is given), you may also be asked to submit a draft of a letter, which will be modified based on Maggi’s experience with you, made more glamorous (people are much too humble about themselves!), and edited to add anything you left out that Maggi thinks is important.

Maggi completed her Ph.D. at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (Japan), where she worked under Prof. Satoshi Mitarai to comprehensively characterize the symbiosis between acantharian protists and the Haptophyte phytoplankton Phaeocystis. Side projects and ongoing interests from Okinawa include investigating how typhoons and urbanization disturb coastal ecosystems. Recent research focuses on positive and negative interactions between Phaeocystis and their colony microbiomes, and the impact these interactions may have on bloom formation. Maggi is passionate about science communication, outreach, and building an inclusive and supportive lab.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAndreas Norlin is joining the MICO lab as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLydia Ruggles is joining the MICO lab as an M.Sc. student in Fall 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOlivia Blondheim is a Ph.D. student in Dr. Chris Stallings’ Fish Ecology Lab at USF CMS.
