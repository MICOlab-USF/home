Maggi completed her Ph.D. at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (Japan), where she worked under Prof. Satoshi Mitarai to comprehensively characterize the symbiosis between acantharian protists and the Haptophyte phytoplankton Phaeocystis. Side projects and ongoing interests from Okinawa include investigating how typhoons and urbanization disturb coastal ecosystems. Recent research focuses on positive and negative interactions between Phaeocystis and their colony microbiomes, and the impact these interactions may have on bloom formation. Maggi is passionate about science communication, outreach, and building an inclusive and supportive lab.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAndreas Norlin is joining the MICO lab as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLydia Ruggles is joining the MICO lab as an M.Sc. student in Fall 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOlivia Blondheim is a Ph.D. student in Dr. Chris Stallings’ Fish Ecology Lab at USF CMS.
